Title: bsnsing: A package for decision tree learning with Boolean sensing
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Yanchao Liu

Description: The bsnsing package provides functions for building a decision tree classifier and making predictions. It solves the two-class and multi-class classification problems under the supervised learning paradigm. While building a decision tree, bsnsing uses a Boolean rule involving multiple variables to split a node. Each split rule is identified by solving an optimization model that minimizes misclassification as well as complexity. Compared to other decision tree learners that seek single-variable splits in a greedy fashion, bsnsing's approach is more holistic and produces highly interpretable and accurate trees.
