Title: bsnsing: A decision tree induction method based on recursive optimal boolean rule composition
Version: 1.0.1

Description: The bsnsing package provides functions for training a decision tree classifier, making predictions and generating latex code for plotting. It solves the two-class and multi-class classification problems under the supervised learning paradigm. While building a decision tree, bsnsing uses a Boolean rule involving multiple variables to split a node. Each split rule is identified by solving an optimization problem. Use the bsnsing() function to build a tree, the predict() function to make predictions and the show() function to plot the tree. The paper is at <arXiv.2205.15263>.
